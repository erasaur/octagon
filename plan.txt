dates -> createdAt
name/owner/etc -> userId
member usernames -> use ids
occasion -> description
officer -> admin

remove useless helper functions (permissions has a few)
remove stuff like console logs and collectionfs debugging
remove annoying alerts? close modal after adding new event member?

use pagination package
visit other ppl's profiles?
abstract club-specific things into settings, like website/school name, style, etc
limit number of pictures sent to admin page (pagination)
consistent naming with modals and forms.. eg add is used for modals and new is used for forms
test all forms, use hooks to show success/error not event handlers

allow selecting images from gallery for creating event
move picture creation to common method

progress:
replace error messages with constants (also labels for schema)
handle pictures in events/pictures collections together
"" -> ''
autovalue instead of optional in schema
trash inline styling...
trash br's ... use clearfix not ninja divs

done:
improve register/login/change password (use autoform)
quickform templates
use schema errors
show markdown in handlebars
fix dates (consider toDateString(), but will have to change getDate(), editing events, adding events, displaying, etc) (moment)
fix the whitespace issue
ensure that all number inputs are actually numbers (schema)
collection schemas
use collectionfs instead of managing pictures manually
events page -- move all the if statements into a helper, and just render the text
sanitation of inputs, markdown
set up permissions
don't use separate ids
find a way to reduce the amount of modals
easy search for members?

future:
implement window effect
implement email (on contact page, and for notifications)
referrals, pictures & events, etc
adding pictures to posts
event cancellation
style pictures page
