dates -> createdAt
name/owner/etc -> userId
member usernames -> use ids
occasion -> description
officer -> admin

consistent naming with modals and forms.. eg add is used for modals and new is used for forms
test all forms, use hooks to show success/error not event handlers
improve change password (use autoform)
use pagination package and easy search
use autoform for login/change pass/register
autovalue instead of optional in schema
allow selecting images from gallery for creating event
move picture creation to common method
abstract club-specific things like settings, website name, style, etc
use collectionfs instead of managing pictures manually
trash inline styling...
trash br's ... use clearfix not ninja divs
don't use separate ids
find a way to reduce the amount of modals
easy search for members?
set up permissions
sanitation of inputs, markdown
events page -- move all the if statements into a helper, and just render the text

progress:
replace error messages with constants (also labels for schema)
handle pictures in events/pictures collections together
"" -> ''

done:
fix dates (consider toDateString(), but will have to change getDate(), editing events, adding events, displaying, etc) (moment)
fix the whitespace issue
ensure that all number inputs are actually numbers (schema)
collection schemas

future:
implement window effect
implement email (on contact page, and for notifications)
referrals, pictures & events, etc
adding pictures to posts
event cancellation
style pictures page
